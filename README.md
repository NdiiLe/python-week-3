FINDING INSPIRATION
 knowing how to accomplish the program. Use python script to keep track of things.

HAVE DIFFERENT HOBBIES
 Reflect on your daily routine, have tasks streamlined instead of just waking up and using your phone.

USER STORIES
 Always have a general idea for your next python project. Have small scenarios from a user perspective, the story should emphasize the users goals and motivation instead of the application itself.
Also consider the needs of an administrator role. 

USE CASES
 Instead of using user stories, you can make use of the other planning tool called a "USE CASE". This includes a title, an actor and a scenario that describes how a goal is achieved. It can be written as a paragraph or a list of steps in simple language.

 They may seem similar but they capture different information. USER STORIES focuses more on "who, what, and why of a task or goal" while USE CASES focuses on "who, what, and how of achieving the goal." these complement each other.
